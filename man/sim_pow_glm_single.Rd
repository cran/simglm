\title{Function to simulate power.}
\usage{
sim_pow_glm_single(fixed, fixed_param, cov_param, n, data_str,
  cor_vars = NULL, fact_vars = list(NULL), contrasts = NULL, outcome_type,
  knot_args = list(NULL), missing = FALSE, missing_args = list(NULL),
  pow_param = NULL, alpha, pow_dist = c("z", "t"), pow_tail = c(1, 2),
  glm_fit_mod = NULL, glm_fit_family, general_mod = NULL,
  general_extract = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{fixed}{One sided formula for fixed effects in the simulation. 
To suppress intercept add -1 to formula.}

\item{fixed_param}{Fixed effect parameter values (i.e. beta weights). 
Must be same length as fixed.}

\item{cov_param}{List of arguments to pass to the continuous generating 
function, must be the same order as the variables specified in fixed. 
This list does not include intercept, time, factors, or 
interactions. Required arguments include:
\itemize{
  \item dist_fun: This is a quoted R distribution function.
  \item var_type: This is the level of variable to generate. Must be 
    'single'. 
    Must be same order as fixed formula above.
}
Optional arguments to the distribution functions are in a nested list,
 see the examples or vignettes for example code.}

\item{n}{Cluster sample size.}

\item{data_str}{Type of data. Must be "cross", "long", or "single".}

\item{cor_vars}{A vector of correlations between variables.}

\item{fact_vars}{A nested list of factor, categorical, or ordinal variable 
   specification, each list must include:
\itemize{
     \item numlevels: Number of levels for ordinal or factor variables.
     \item var_type: Must be 'single'.
 }
 Optional arguments include:
 \itemize{
     \item replace
     \item prob
     \item value.labels
 }
  See also \code{\link{sample}} for use of these optional arguments.}

\item{contrasts}{An optional list that specifies the contrasts to be used 
for factor variables (i.e. those variables with .f or .c). 
See \code{\link{contrasts}} for more detail.}

\item{outcome_type}{A vector specifying the type of outcome, must be either
logistic or poisson. Logitstic outcome will be 0/1 and poisson outcome will
be counts.}

\item{knot_args}{A nested list of named knot arguments. See \code{\link{sim_knot}} 
for more details. Arguments must include:
  \itemize{
    \item var
    \item knot_locations
  }}

\item{missing}{TRUE/FALSE flag indicating whether missing data should be 
simulated.}

\item{missing_args}{Additional missing arguments to pass to the missing_data 
function. See \code{\link{missing_data}} for examples.}

\item{pow_param}{Name of variable to calculate power for, must be a name 
from fixed.}

\item{alpha}{What should the per test alpha rate be used for the hypothesis 
testing.}

\item{pow_dist}{Which distribution should be used when testing hypothesis 
test, z or t?}

\item{pow_tail}{One-tailed or two-tailed test?}

\item{glm_fit_mod}{Valid glm syntax to be used for model fitting.}

\item{glm_fit_family}{Valid family syntax to pass to the glm function.}

\item{general_mod}{Valid model syntax. This syntax can be from any R package. 
By default, broom is used to extract model result information. Note, 
package must be defined or loaded prior to running the sim_pow function.}

\item{general_extract}{A valid function to extract model results if 
general_mod argument is used. This argument is primarily used if extracting model
results is not possibly using the broom package. If this is left NULL (default), 
broom is used to collect model results.}

\item{...}{Additional specification needed to pass to the random generating 
function defined by with_err_gen.}
}
\description{
Input simulation conditions and which term to compute power for, export 
reported power.
}
\details{
Power function to compute power for a regression term for simple generalized 
regression models. This function would need to be replicated to make any 
statement about power.  Use \code{\link{sim_pow_glm}} as a convenient wrapper
for this.
}
\seealso{
\code{\link{sim_pow_glm}} for a wrapper to replicate.
