\usage{
replicate_simulation(sim_args, expression = NULL, return_list = FALSE,
  ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{sim_args}{A named list with special model formula syntax. See details and examples
for more information. The named list may contain the following:
\itemize{
  \item fixed: This is the fixed portion of the model (i.e. covariates)
  \item random: This is the random portion of the model (i.e. random effects)
  \item error: This is the error (i.e. residual term).
}}

\item{expression}{Simulation, model fitting, and coefficient extraction
expressions for a single replication.}

\item{return_list}{TRUE/FALSE indicating whether a full list output should be
returned. If TRUE, the nested list is returned. If FALSE, replications are 
combined with a replication id appended.}

\item{...}{Currently not used.}
